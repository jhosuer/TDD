Write a function that will take two arrays, return a third array that will contain the elements of the two arrays,
one after the order. The length of the array must not necessarily be equal and in that case, when one array runs out of
elements, the second one continues until all elements are added;
Example

concatArrays([1,5,4,6,8],[7,1,0,6]) => [1,7,5,1,4,0,6,6,8]
concatArrays(['a','c','e'],['b','d','f','g','h']) => ['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h']
