/*Given two arrays, E and F, of non-negative integer scores. A "unique" score is one which is a multiple of 10, such as 50 or 60. Return the sum of largest unique score in E and the largest unique score in F. 

Hint: 
uniqueScore({12, 10, 4}, {2, 20, 30}) → 40
uniqueScore({20, 10, 4}, {2, 20, 10}) → 40
uniqueScore({12, 11, 4}, {2, 20, 31}) → 20
