For two strings to be isomorphic, all occurrences of a character in string
A can be replaced with another character to get string B. The order of the
characters must be preserved. These must be a one-to-one mapping for every
char of string A to every char of string B.

isIsomorphic(abb) => egg
isIsomorphic(dcd) => bgb
